# Services migration scaffolding

This directory defines domain-oriented modules that form stable orchestration boundaries
for future microservice extraction while preserving existing monolith behavior.

Current boundaries:

- auth
- workspace/team
- request/composer
- sync/presence
- analytics/observability
- billing/subscriptions
